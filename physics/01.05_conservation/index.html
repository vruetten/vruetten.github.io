    <div class="text-justify"><p>Even without the law of action and reaction, the law of conservation of momentum would still hold, but it is difficult to expose under static conditions.</p>

<p>One famous law is the law of conservation of momentum. It simply means that the total of momentum of objects is always constant and never changes. If momentum doesn’t change, objects never change their velocity spontaneously - it is a similar idea to law of inertia. Actually, the law of inertia is part of the law of conservation of momentum.</p>

<p>Law of conservation of momentum has more meaning than the law of inertia. When two objects collide with each other, the total momentum is the same before and after of those two objects. There need not only be 2 objetcs. There could be any number. Even if thousands of objects hit each other and move in very complex ways, the total momentum is always same. It never changes.</p>

<p>The law of conservation of momentum:
<center><strong>No matter how complex movement is, the total momentum of a system never changes.</strong></center></p>

<p>Total momentum is not just the summation of each momentum. Momentum has directionality like velocity. When the upwards momentum is added onto downward one, the momentums cancel each other other out. Leftward one and rightward one are summed in the same way. If two momenta have the same amplitude but are of opposite direction, than the sume of these two momentums are zero. So momentum is easy to understand if you draw an arrow with its length indicating its amplitude, and its direction as the direction of the momentum. It makes intuitive sense and makes things easier to calculate. Such an expression is called a vector. We can sum momentums as we sum vectors. The reader of this article likely understands such things. If you don’t understand it, please take the time to read a high school math textbook.</p>

<p>By the way, can an object start to move by itself? “By it self” means that the object does not receive any influence from outside. Such a situation has never been found.</p>

<h2 id="moving-the-earth">Moving the Earth</h2>

<p>Objects must get momentum from something in order for it to change its movement.
When an object is falling down, the object receives momentum from the earth via gravity, and the earth is also approaching the object with equal momentum. When you jump upwards, the earth is kicked away from you and moves downward. When you push a wall, the earth starts to rotate. When you run, the kicked earth rotates backwards.</p>

<p>I’m not cheating or exaggerating. It's just that the momentum you can give to such an enormous mass like the earth results in it moving very slowly. However small, it is true that the earth is influenced by you and starts moving because of you. However, the earth doesn’t necessarily continue to rotate forever because of you.
You will stop running soon enough, and at that time, you will stop with kicking the earth, and the earth will stop rotating from your movement.</p>

<p><strong>In order for momentum to be constant, action and reaction are everywhere.  Yes, the law of conservation of momentum contains the law of action and reaction. Reaction aries from giving momentum to some object.</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps I confuse you by choosing as example the earth which has a too huge mass.
I can explain it in the same way by considering walking on a log floating on water.</p>

<p>If you walk from the end to end of the log, the log moves backward from you as well.
When you stop moving, the log stops as well. If you come back to original position, the log comes back to its original location, too. Even you run to the end and come back with walking, the result is same.</p>

<h2 id="movement-of-the-center-of-mass">Movement of the center of mass</h2>

<p>From the law of the conservation of momentum, we can introduce a principle: that the center of mass is always at same position, as long as it doesn't recieve external momentum. If a boat hit your log, the center of mass of the log and you would begin to move. However if you move on the log, the center of mass of the log and you is always in the same location, and never moves.</p>

<p>Let’s introduce the principle described.
First, the center of mass is a location to be calculated as follows:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\(X = \frac{m_a x_a + m_b x_b}{m_a + m_b}\)</span>
where I denote $m_a$ and $m_b$ as the mass of two objects, and $x_a$ and $x_b$ as their positions.</p>

<p>You can find the meaning of this equation, if you change the coordinates such that the origin is the center of mass:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[x'_a = x_a - X\\ x'_b = x_b - X\]</span></p>

<p>If you substitute these expressio in the  previous equation, you can get the following answer:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[X = \frac{m_a (x'_a  + X) + m_b (x'_B  + X)}{m_a + m_b}\\ \]</span></p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\therefore 0 = m_a x'_a  + m_b x'_b\\ \therefore m_a x'_a = - m_b x'_b\]</span></p>

<p>This means that if you multiply the mass of an object and distance from origin to the object, the result will be the same if you consider the second object, located at the opposite side from the origin. This is same analogy as when the seesaw is in its equilibrium. If you hold the seesaw at the center of mass, the two points of mass counterbalance each other completely.</p>

<p>The total momentum of these two objects are constant, denoted as c.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[m_a v_a + m_b v_b = c\]</span></p>

<p>We can express this equation as following as well.
<span  class="math">\(\frac{m_a v_a + m_b v_b}{dt} = c\)</span></p>

<p>The formula inside the paranthesis is similar to that of the center of mass. It shows means that the temporal change of the numerator of the center of mass is constant. The denominator of the center of mass is constant, so we can say that the location of the center of mass moves with constant speed. If the initial velocity was zero, it stays zero and never moves. We can find out interesting things by just transforming equations.</p>

<h2 id="conservation-of-momentum-is-just-a-rule-of-thumb">Conservation of momentum is just a rule of thumb</h2>

<p>From our experience so far, we can say that momentum is always conserved. Physics results from learning from nature, so if some counter example of a law is observed in natural world, we have to do away with the rule.</p>

<p>Historically, during experiments looking into beta decay of protons, people got some results which made them suspect that the momentum wasn't conserved in their system - this became big news. Later, they investigated it in detail, and they found a new particle called a neutrino, which is very difficult to detect. The particles took away momentum in the experiment. In the end, they found that the momentum was actually conserved and everyone was much relieved.</p>

<p>At that time, we had to make sure that the laws in physics were followed by all experiments at any time. Physicists firmly believe that the law is “true” - when they find a counterexample, they have flexible enough minds to accept this and amend the laws after thorough investigation. Breaking laws is the opportunity to develop physics, rather than the end of the physical system. It is great marvel to learn new laws from the nature.</p>

<p>Physicists always desire some known laws to be broken, but they don’t want to be disturbed or misled by unreliable information. So, they first suspect - they are skeptics. They don't just keep old laws for the sake of it.</p>

<p>The law of conservation of momentum has never been broken. In other words, we’ve never found counterexample of it thus far.</p>
