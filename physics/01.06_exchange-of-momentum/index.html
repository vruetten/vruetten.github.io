    <div class="text-justify"><p>Is force truly exchange of momentum? -it is strange that we can feel force when nothing is moving, isn’t it?-</p>

<p>I wrote that “force is a phenomenon of exchanging momentum”, but I started to wonder if it is 100% true, so I decided to write this article. Acutely, I sometimes find some phenomena, which is counterexample of this. If I can’t explain about it, I have to retract the previous articles, unfortunately.</p>

<p>For example, how about magnets? If you put the same pole together, you can feel the “force”. It is repulsive force. If you hold magnets with your hands with same pole of magnets close each other, you still feel the force. However, nothing moves in this condition, so there is no change in momentum. Why do we feel force even without change of momentum?</p>

<p>A spring has same story. If you compress a spring, you need force to keep its shape. In this case also, nothing is moved there, so momentum doesn’t change at all does it? Squeezing an inflated balloon is good example, too. We can feel the restoring force as spring case.</p>

<p>How can I explain about it? I was struggling when I wrote this article, but I may be able to explain about balloon case relatively easily.</p>

<p>Restoring force of balloon
When we squeeze a balloon, the air inside of it wouldl have more intense molecular motion. The molecules hit against the membrane of balloon, and try to spread to the original area. When the molecules hit the membrane and hit back from it, the momentum of molecules is changed. Of course the membrane, which was hit by molecule, receives its momentum. However, the membrane receives momentum from your hand, which is opposite direction from molecules one, so those momentum is canceled out, so the balloon doesn’t start to move in this case.</p>

<p>When you squeeze a balloon, the restoring force which you feel in you hands is the momentum of the molecules of the air hitting to the balloon’s membrane, and you feel it through the membrane. When you squeeze a balloon, you push back the bullet of air molecules without notice it.</p>

<p>When you press the balloon using your both hands from left and right side, the balloon give momentum to your left hand and right hand with opposite directions, so even you got momentum, you won’t start to move. However, if you tackle huge, thick enough balloon, you will bounce back from it. This is result from that you get momentum from air molecules.</p>

<p>Further more, let’s think about when you lay down on an air cushion. Apparently, you didn’t get any momentum, and you just stay on the cushion. However, even in this case, the momentum is always exchanged. You are falling down with receiving momentum from the earth, but bullets of enormous numbers of molecules in the cushion keep shooting you from below. With reaction of it, you can float on the cushion. The exchange is precisely balanced and extremely quick, so you feel like staying still, but under your body, there is intense battle of exchanging momentum. The molecules of air have battle at bottom side of the cushion to give momentum to the earth, so the earth gets back the momentum there as much as it gives to you.</p>

<p>Rubber band and spring’s restoring forces.
Then, the restoring forces of rubber band is also the result of molecular motion of rubber, and I can explain it as same way as the balloon case. I won't talk about what the force come from, but if you read a text book of thermodynamics or statistical mechanics, you will find the answer.</p>

<p>Then, how about spring? It is little bit different from the balloon case. The restoring force of spring is from that the atoms of metals trying to go back to original position, and it is originally from electromagnetic force between atoms to maintain its relative positions. I’d like you to learn it deeper. I don’t know about it so much. If it is made of metal, I just think about metallic bound between atoms, but recently, we have springs made of plastic, ceramics, rubber or so, so I can’t explain what is common sauce of the force, and what is different among those materials. The detail is totally different, but it is not very different from magnets case.</p>

<p>The force from magnets
OK, I felt the magnet case is most difficult to explain, but because I explained something about balloon case, I feel better to explain about it. In summary, the magnets also exchange momentum all the time.  The idea is from particle physics, but the magnetic force is generated by exchange of lights which has some momentum. If the each poles become close each other, they can exchange the lights more, and we can feel stronger force. If we don’t hold the magnets, they would start moving with receiving the momentum to repulse each other. In order to cancel it out, we have to give momentum to them to hold it. The holding hand looked stationary, but it is giving momentum with precise amount to hold it. This is the reason why we feel the force.</p>

<p>As such cases, there are so many examples that something looks stationary, but exchanging momentum. It is very common scenery, but if there is a box on a desk, the box receives momentum from the earth always. The surface of the desk and boxes, the molecules of them kicked out each other, and exchange their momentum in order not to mix each other. This is called “normal force”, which you may learn in middle high school.</p>

<p>Then, It sounds ok to say,”the force is result of exchanging forces”. I explained that the force is how much momentum is transferred in given unit time, and equilibrium of force means that the sum of momentum in infinitesimal time is canceled.</p>
