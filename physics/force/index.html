    <div class="text-justify"><p>Dynamics is easy. The point is that a static object is always static, and a moving object is always moving with same velocity, unless there is friction. This is the “law of inertia’.</p>

<p>A static object starts moving, if force acts on it. If force acts on a moving object, it changes velocity. If it is in the right condition, the moving object might stop moving. Our environment usually has “friction”, so it is very common that a moving object stops moving, but if there is no friction, stopping movement is extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Next, I’d like to talk about what is force, but it will be philosophical, if we talk about it deeply (more on this later).</p>

<p>We can discuss physics in different ways if we change points of view. Here, I am trying to explain it from a different angle from conventional physics textbooks. Definitions are extremely important for scientific discussions. It is confusing if you discuss something without deciding the premise first. Some people argue about something whilst changing the premise, but such discussions are not reliable. We should be suspicious of such people.</p>

<h3 id="momentum-and-force">Momentum and Force</h3>

<p>Here, let’s consider that <strong>there is force if an object changes its movement</strong>.  <strong>A thing which changes movement of an object is force</strong>.</p>

<p>The force should have an amplitude, but how should we decide it? Let’s decide it by how much the movement of an object is changed. Then, what is movement of an object? Is it its velocity? It shouldn’t be only velocity. Even for the same velocity, we should consider that there are heavy things and light things. From our experience, we can see that we need strong forces to move a heavy objects.</p>

<p>For example we feel more fatigue when we stop a slowly moving train than when we stop a very fast tennis ball with our bare hand. I think. I don’t want to experience such things. Oh, yes, a car! I have experienced pushing a car. It was very hard to stop the car, once it started to move. I’ve seen the flipping of the direction of steam locomotive only with a turntable and human strength, and it looked very hard too.</p>

<p>So, let’s multiply the velocity with the weight of the object. This is called “momentum” in the field of physics. The heavier the object is, the larger the momentum is. And, the bigger the velocity is, the larger the momentum is, too.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[p = m v\]</span></p>

<p>where $p$ is momentum, $m$ is weight and $v$ velocity.</p>

<p>If you look at this, it is true that the momentum are same if an object has 2 in weight and 1 in velocity, or 1 in weight and 2 in velocity. It is excellent if you are wondering whether this is true, but it is not meaningful right now. It is just defining a quantity, “momentum”, as it is, and if it was not convenient for us, we just define better quantity for our purpose. Physics has been developed just like that way. Actually, the definition of the “momentum” is very convenient and this idea helps us a lot to understand the world’s nature without contradiction and in a simple manner.</p>

<p><strong>Force just indicates how much the momentum is changing.</strong>
However, the result should depend on the duration of acting force as well. Of course, it will have larger change if the force acts over a longer period of time. Thus, let's call the quantity that multiplies time with force “impulse”. Impuse should be equivalent as momentum. No. I should change the way of this expression. I just define the unit of force as such, such that we can state “impulse is equivalent to momentum”.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[p = F t\]</span></p>

<p>This formula is just $m\cdot v= Ft$, and it is equivalent that we defined the unit of force with “the force to accelerate an object with 1 kg to 1m/s within 1s is 1N”.
If we transform this, it gives:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[F = m v/t\]</span></p>

<p>And $v/t$ is defined as acceleration, so if I replace it by $a$, we get:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[F = ma\]</span></p>

<p>We get this equation in high school.</p>

<p>In many classes, lecturers directly define that 1 N is the force which results in a 1 kg of object to accelerating at 1$\text{m/s}^2$ in the direction of applied motion. I am not against this, and I think it is clear and straight forward. However, it could give the impression that momentum and force are very different concepts.</p>

<p>We can address physics in many different ways, and each ways has its pros and cons. I think we can truly say we have understood something, when we understand the differences of these ways.</p>
