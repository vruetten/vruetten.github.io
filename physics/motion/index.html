    <div class="text-justify"><p>In the first article,  I denoted acceleration as a, and introduced an equation, F=ma, but at college level, people use differentiation and usually denote the equation as:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[F(t) = m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\]</span></p>

<p>This is called <strong>Newton’s equation of motion</strong>. This notation is more meaningful and we can describe dynamical states more accurately. Once we are familiar with this, it is too convenient to go back to old definition. This way of expressing force has existed since Newton’s age, at which the field of dynamics was born. Differentiation was invented by Newton and Leibniz in order to express dynamics accurately.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to use knowledge of the differentiation for a while in this course, but it is essential concept in physics, so here I explain about it briefly. It is better to acquire it step by step.</p>

<h2 id="one-way-of-thinking-about-differentiation">One way of thinking about differentiation</h2>

<p>First of all, what is velocity? The simple answer is that it is the quantity resulting from the division of distance, which an object has moved, by the time, over which the object moved.  However, velocity is not always constant during long-distance travel. It is natural that velocity might change. Then, I might wonder “how fast is it moving now?”, but how can I know this? Even if I am thinking about “the velocity at a moment”, an object looks stationary at any given position.</p>

<p>No, actually it is not completely stationary. It is just “almost stationary”. In a very short time window, if we can measure the tiny distance of the motion, we can still calculate the velocity. It is not a problem that we call the velocity calculated from infinitesimal time interval as “the instantaneous velocity”. We don’t need to be too careful about this, because the velocity shouldn’t vary a lot during such a very short time period.</p>

<p>In brief, in a very short time interval $\Delta t$ and very short distance $\Delta x$ of an object's movement during this period of time, we can calculate $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$, and we can define instantaneous velocity, $v$, when $\Delta t$ is infinitely close to 0. We can denote it as following.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt}\]</span></p>

<p>It would be against the rules of mathematics if I had divided something by 0, but we can nontheless still consider what the value would be, when the denominator approaches 0 gradually. This is differentiation.</p>

<h2 id="the-application-of-differentiation">The application of differentiation</h2>

<p>Let’s reconsider the concept of &quot;impulse&quot; using this concept. The quantity multiplying amplitude of force and time is called impulse, but with the previous way, we calculated it assuming that amplitude of the force, F,  didn’t change for t seconds. Such a strange condition might happen in your examination, but it is rather rare in the real world. Even a quick small punch of yourself shows that force gradually acts on a subject, and gradually disappears.</p>

<p>How can we discuss about impulse under more realistic situation? Similarlt as when discussing instantaneous velocity, we can use the infinitesimal time idea! If we look at really short time interval $\Delta t$, we can assume that the force, F, is constant during this period. Let’s denote the impulse during this period as $F\Delta t$. As a result, momentum slightly changes as a result, so we denote it as $\Delta p$. In other words, we can say $F\Delta t = \Delta p$. We can transform this to $F=\Delta p/ \Delta t$, and if $\Delta t$ approaches to 0, we can denote it as:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[F(t)=\frac{d p}{d t}\]</span></p>

<p>This means that force is rate of temporal change of momentum. Please keep it in your mind that we can write Newton’s equation of motion like this.</p>

<p>Usually, momentum changes because of a change of velocity, because mass, m, does not change unless the object breaks or so. So, we can denote the change of momentum as $\Delta p = m\Delta v$. Thus, $F \Delta t = m \Delta v$ and as you know, we can transform this to:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[F(t) = m\frac{dv}{dt}\]</span></p>

<p>v means that the distancemoved was differentiated by time, and this value is further differentiated by time a second time. So, we can denote this as:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[F(t) = m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\]</span></p>

<p>We can use this equation, when the acceleration is dependent on time.  This means that even if force is dependent on time, we can still compute it at any moment in time.</p>

<p>Let’s stop using this immature method of assuming a constant acceleration as previously done. Because dynamics has used the concept of differentiation since its birth.</p>
