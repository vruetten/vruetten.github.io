<p>It is impolite not to explain about it, if I am talking about dynamics-</p>

<p>I can’t hold a candle to him
We can get information way much more than used to be. The information is sophisticated, too. Maybe because of this, so many people seems to misunderstand that modern people is the most intelligent.</p>

<p>Even though I thanked to the past great people as they construct the basis of the science, but I couldn’t find the reason why I respected them, until recently. I think little of past people including Newton, because he lived in old days. This was because my lack of learning.</p>

<p>The accomplishment of Newton is greater than I had expected. Not only that. His formulation is very sophisticated even from the point of view of current physics, and I feel like he would be established in current physics as a genius, if he would revive now.</p>

<p>Three laws
Newton summarized the dynamic system, which he created, as three laws.
The first law (the law of inertia)
The velocity of an object is constant unless it receives some eternal action. Moving objects keep moving, and stationary objects keep stationary.
The second law (definition of force)
The acceleration of a object is correlated with the amplitude of force acting on it, and anti-correlated with mass of it. If I express it in a equation, it is following.
PastedGraphic-10.png
The third law (the law of action and reaction)
When an object acting to something else, the object receives force from the opponent as much amplitude as the object gives.</p>

<p>Those three laws are reshaped for modern physics, and originally, it was not expressed clearly as this is, or it was not accurate either. However, I’m not comfortable to nitpick from pioneers. It is important work to correct previous mistake, but I don’t think it is right attitude to triumphantly point it out.</p>

<p>Why did he note them in three laws.
Those three laws are showed up in my articles already. Newton should know about the concept of momentum more than me, but he didn’t treat it as principal law. There were various reasons not to do it.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the first law from beginning. In the second law, if F=0, the acceleration is 0, so the first law seems not to be necessary. However, the first law is called “law of inertia” as well, and it is important part to set the stage for the second law and third law.</p>

<p>At that time, the concept about “force” was strongly influenced by an idea from the age of Aristotle. This was type of an idea that when you threw a javelin, the javelin flew further because force kept acting on it, and when the force was out, the javelin fell down. It was intuitive for me. I myself thought same way when I was an elementary school student with throwing a stick to a vegetable field in my neighbor. When I read a cartoon of Galileo Galilei’s biography, I was very surprised. It was impossible for me that an objects keep moving without being acted by anything!</p>

<p>So, he had to break the old concept with the first law. Actually, Galilei already did it, but he had to made sure about it, but the meaning of the first low is not only that.</p>

<p>When we are on a train, and the train start moving, we feel like falling over. Even nothing is acting on us, our bodies feel like accelerating. Also, when we stand on a turning table, we feel centrifugal force. Centrifugal force doesn’t mean that some one pulling you, but just you feel it. Such cases without apparent/fictitious force, we call it “inertial system”.</p>

<p>The first law explain about inertial system, and it is essential premise. It says we shouldn’t apply second law or third law with out this premise.</p>

<p>The second law is “definition of force” based on acceleration. Because he denied the concept of Aristotelian, he had to show alternative definition. If there is no first law, the definition became unclear. It looks like a explanation that how much an object would be accelerated, when some amplitude of force acting on it, but with an interpretation from a point of view from history of science philosophy, the second law rather means definition of force.</p>

<p>Newton was a person who summarized the motion of celestial bodies or force that the earth is pulling us, as “universal gravitation” to unify the ideas, so it seems to be very natural for him to describe concepts with basing on the force. Also, it is very meaningful to express the equation of motion as mathematical formula.</p>

<p>The idea of the third law is originally from him. It simply describes the character of force. &quot;The fictitious force”, which we can feel it from outside of inertial system, is not satisfy with this law. From these fact, we can infer how important the first law is.

Dear Virginia,</p>

<p>I will explain about what is apparent force with relating to this article, but It is very difficult to explain, about the fictitious force. If your point of view is accelerated, the stationary object you see should look like decelerate, but there is no force, and if your point of view decelerate, the moving object with constant velocity looks like accelerate, but it there is no force as well. However, if you don’t know that you are accelerating or decelerating, you just think there is force on the abject. Difference is noting get reaction of it. Nothing start moving opposite direction the object you are observing. Why do we feel it as force? That’s interesting perception of our brain, I think.(depends on how to construct internal model and perspective of it for our brain). If your internal model refer to the train as environment, brain will consider that the environment as “inertial system”, but if it is not true, the something mismatch from reference seems to be considered as “force”.</p>

<p>Example what I talked earlier
The moon goes around the earth. Only a force acting on this system is gravity of these two objects. However, if you are the moon, you will feel the centrifugal force, which directs opposite to direction to the earth. Actually, the moon just keep moving straight perpendicular to moon-earth axis, but because of the gravity, the trajectory is distorted. From the point of view of the moon, it tries to follow the straight trajectory. So, we can feel the  difference between circular velocity and straight velocity as “force”. This is just inertia, but not force actually.  In this case, this is equivalent thing to transform from euclidian coordinate to spherical coordinate. In the spherical coordinate, the moon behave like moving with constant velocity, and the gravity and some extra force looked like canceled each other. The extra force is actually centrifugal force, but actually this is just inertia of moon’s strait movement in euclidian coordinate. Thus, spherical coordinate system is out side of “inertial system”, because the point of view is changes its direction of velocity constantly, as your point of view is accelerating. In this case, the Newton’s laws are not applicable. I think the moon-centered coordinate should have similar compensation, but calculation is not easy, and it won’t be called centrifugal force, so let me retract the idea.</p>
