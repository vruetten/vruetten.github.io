    <div class="text-justify"><p>In previous article, when I defined momentum, I used the term “weight”, because it is easier to understand for physics beginners, but it is extremely bad practice in physics, because weight is a type of quantity which depends on the environment.</p>

<p>For example, if we go to the surface of the moon, gravity is smaller there than on the earth, so the weight of an object becomes six times smaller. We can also feel our body becoming heavier or lighter when you are in a lift going up or down, respectively. (Recently, the lift is improved and less uncomfortable, but I am afraid that it might hinder the teaching of physics.)</p>

<p>Should we consider weight as a property of an object, even though the quantity is easily affected by external factors? Also, momentum becames zero, if there is no gravity, but actually this is not true. Even such a case, an object seems to have a “weight-like property”.</p>

<p>We call a quantity, which is very similar to “weight”, but that does not depend on gravity, as “mass”. So, in previous article when definiting momentum, I noted that m as “weight”, but I’d like you to replace it to “mass”. That is the correct definition of momentum.</p>

<p>If we think about it carefully, we interpret “weight” as the apparent force that the earth exerts on object. No. I shouldn’t limit it only to the earth. If we go to the moon, we would probably consider “weight” as the force by which the moon pulls on an object. Actually, “weight” is a term referring to a type of “force” in physics.</p>

<p>If we drop an object at a point near the surface of the earth, the object gains an acceleration with 9.8 m/(s^2). We call this the earth’s “gravitational acceleration”. If we look back at the previous equation, the quantity multiplying mass m with acceleration was a force. Thus, we can say that the amplitude of the force by whic the earth pulls on an object with a 1kg mass is 9.8 N. This force is weight!</p>

<p>Even after reading this story, you shouldn't be nervous about it. In daily life, weight and mass have almost the same meaning, and you don’t need to distinguish them. We usually use the unit of weight as “gram or lbs”, but it is not a problem. However, when you are in the &quot;physics context&quot;, we should use the correct terms, and it is important not to confuse the meanings. In physics, the unit of mass is unified as “kg”.</p>

<p>In engineering, people sometimes define the units of force as “kg-forces”. This often shows up in specification tables of certain machines. The gravitational force to 1 kg object is not 9.8 N but 1kgw in their case. It is more intuitive because we don’t need to multiply 9.8 for that, and we can see “it is as strong as a force as when I have a 1 kg object in my hand”.</p>

<p>However, in physics, we never use this unit, and it is unified to newton, N. The school are not just charitable places to impart knowledge to people; it also aims to raise people for them to contribute to economic activities, so we sometimes have to learn such a content for industrial requirements. What? Nobody learns “kgs” of “kgw”, in these days? Even so, it is not completely useless. You can expand your perspective if you have broad knowledge, even it is not directly related to what you are doing.</p>
